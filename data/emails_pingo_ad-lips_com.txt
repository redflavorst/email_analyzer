제목: Design proposal on the Lotto Soudal helmet...
내용:
Hi Rex, Please pass following to your designers. As the Jersey has a lot of red, the red in the helmet should be very reduced to have a more tasty complete style of the rider.
My proposals on the FURION:
1. Top Micro Shell matt white 2. Bottom Micro Shell glossy white 3. HJC Logo just with a red outline (inside white) 4. Behind the Logo on the rear of the helmet the stripes in black and yellow of the Belgium flag like you see on the sleeve of the jersey
This helmet would sell like hell….. I promise

제목: Report about my talk with Victor Campenaerts during the fitting day
내용:
You must know that Victor had experiences during the process of designing and and developing the LAZER TT helmet.
What I watched and understand
- first day, you go to the wind tunnel with a) the rider. the HJC engineer , the Belgium wind tunnel engineer who knows the local technic, 1 Korean guy with perfect English and knowhow about road racing and Pingo (if missing this guy it would be a communication disaster and so we probably have to find this guy as a temporary consultant for that week)
b) a dummy for the laser beams test, they have in-house
c) different raw models of the tt helmet with different fixing(buckles) and paddings to change à la minute, HJC has to bring
d) a lap top with the software to create information for the 3D printer, the HJC engineer has to bring
e) a 3D printer to create new shell à la minute after newest info, we have to borrow one from the area ( do I have to research where and how?)
f) the time trial bike of Victor , he’ll bring it
g) a 2nd time trial bike for the dummy from RIDLEY

- 2nd day ( maybe 1-3 days after first day, because lots of work in between) Victor and dummy will be in the tunnel with newest 3D model to get next step of info and result
- 3rd day hopefully latest and nearly perfect 3D model in the tunnel for getting information that the best ever prototype 3D version of TT helmet is born If not
- 4th day to continue if necessary
- total 5-7 days process
Pingo

Hi Rex, I’m kind of sure that with https://www.floez.de I found our best possible partner to design more helmets as their experience is unbelievable. I will have a personal meeting with them next Tuesday or Wednesday and after that they or I will forward you more details and questions. They often worked together with Ralf Kindermann (the guy who headhunted me) in different projects and now also for Recaro in a children safety project.
Study some links here and always scroll down:

By the way, they also design snow helmets

제목: Re: Lotto Soudal > design Helmet
내용:
Hello all,
As the team Jersey already is carrying a lot of red I’m sure that the complete look of the rider will look much more tasteful and cool when there is not too much red in the helmet. I also learned that the socks of the riders will be mainly black and then you would have a cool picture of rider with black on the bottom and the top and here are my favorites for IBEX(left) and FURION(right)

If you think it could be cool, cause always some of the riders prefer FURION and other the IBEX, to have a mix of white and black this would be my favorite IBEX design

Then a little but very important detail are the colors of the Belgium flag ( black/gold(yellow)/white) like on your jersey sleeve below If you put this into the stripes of the FURION behind the logo the helmet already is black, the 2 stripes are already red and then you just change one of the 2 stripes into yellow and this I think, no I’m sure, is a must! Do you understand? And by the way for the Ibex use yellow letters for the logo and then even this helmet would carry the Belgium colors….very little, very detailed!

Thanks for your attention!
Ciao Pingo

Hi Rex, If you realize for the FURION helmets Mallorca To take this helmet

And add one red and one yellow stripe to the rear part you are my hero! And to be my hero this time it’s so easy that it would be stupid, it would be a crime not to use this chance. And never, ever go for a design with a lot of red, cause then the rider would be totally over designed!
Nobody in this world can tell me that those 2 stripes in form of stickers to mount there for 40 helmets isn’t possible….nobody can!
Please understand and do!!!

As we already mentioned before, we have a team camp from 12 till 20 December, and it would be great to have there already the personalized helmets for the fotoshoot, especially because we’re going to use these foto’s the hole season 2018. And that would also be a pity for HJC... If it’s not possible to have a helmet for everyone, can we get one per size?

Jan 1st: ( no earlier ) pictures of team made in Mallorca and professionell pdf to spread into all contacts each of us has in the bike biz.
Do you have high res pic of just FURION in LOTTO SOUDAL design to post on Instagram? Can you make me admin of HJC Sports Instagram that I also can make our potential social media consulting admin? How can Tim mount my pingo@hjc-helmet.com mail address to my Mac?

제목: Important and interesting contact...
내용:
Hello Mr. Hong and Mr. Choi, I will forward a mail to you which I’ve received from Greg Shapleigh through LinkedIn. Greg Shapleigh was working for Giro since the beginning of the 90ties till mid of this year. The last years he was Vice President of Easton/Bell and I think there are not many with more experience in the sport helmet business and I think you should listen to him. Also it would be easy for you as he’s willing to travel to Korea to meet you. Let me know if I should contact him before you’ll do this directly?
Hello Rex, Thank you for translating this to Mr. Hong and Mr. Choi.
Greatings still from sunny Miami Pingo

Hello Pingo.   I hope this message finds you well. It's great fun to follow your adventures on Instagram!  As you may know, I'm doing some consulting work for MIPS - the Swedish helmet technology provider.   Would you be willing to introduce me to some of your colleagues at HJC? I'm interested to learn more about their perspectives on the MIPS technologies (for both cycling and motorcycle applications)?  I learned a lot about MIPS during my time at Giro and Bell. We spent 2 years evaluating the technology and ultimately determined that it made our helmets better. I can share some case studies from several brands that have adopted the technology.  I'm sure that people at HJC have interacted with MIPS over the years ... but I'm also sure that I can add something to the conversation.  I'm willing to travel to Korea to facilitate the discussion.  Please let me know what you think.  Best regards, Greg Shapleigh gregshapleigh@gmail.com

제목: Samples for RIDLEY our Benelux distributer 
내용:
Hi Carles, first I want to say sorry that Jochim (I had a meeting with him last Thursday)  just contacted you directly without putting Jin and Rex also in CC to avoid making you confuse. But now after Rex explained you should know what it was about?
Below you’ll see the order of 7 samples sets with which our Benelux distributer will send its sales team on to the road. ( Info for Paul and Rex …..they have 6 reps on the road but also need 1 set for their showroom =7 sets )
I know that not all helmets are in the warehouse of HJCE now but as soon as they arrive those 6 times 7 helmets (total42) should be send to RIDLEY. Carles, all additional questions to that like invoicing etc , please ask Rex, but I don’t mind if you keep me in CC.
I should know kind of exactly the arrival of those helmets in Belgium as Jochim asked me to give a product clinic to his sales team.
Thanks a lot Pingo

제목: Sportsnut
내용:
Hi Paul and Rex, yesterday I had a long phonecall with Sven from SPORTSNUT. http://sports-nut.de First, they are interested to become the distributor for Germany. Why: 1. today they have with Birzman accessoiries  and with https://ritte.cc and http://rondo.cc matching brands for the actual HJC program 2. 18 month ago they distributed a competition brand https://kaliprotectives.com what is not fact anymore 3. with lot’s of their brands they builded up a dealer network which is forcing their sales team also to work with a dealer network which later when HJC will offer also urban bicycle helmets would match
Now Sven is asking for China and HJCE pricing and other details he should know and when you’l will mail this he already will realize who’s his contact on this issue.
I will send him conditions we already promise to dealers in Germany that with both informations he can view his potential margin
Next Monday or Tuesday I will meet Sven in Berlin where we together will also visit BIKE-MAILORDER an online shop. It would be good if all infos are exanged till then.
This afternoon I have a phonecall with a friend who knows the Frech market and he will give to me some tipps about how to find our French disti…
I will call Rex now for some questions
Pingo
